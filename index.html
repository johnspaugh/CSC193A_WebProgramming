    <h1>Sonic Music Advertisement</h1>
    <p>
        Sonic origins comes from games going back to the 19990s,
        so technology was limited by the hardware leading to a 
        distint <strong>sound</strong>. Now some people can argue
        Sonic games, shows, or movies are not that good, but we
        overall have a positive view on the music. For example, 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfq6P6BdI0w" />Escape From the City <a/>
         and 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQak222RrEg">Live And Learn</a>
        are early Sonic songs from Sonic's 3D games.
